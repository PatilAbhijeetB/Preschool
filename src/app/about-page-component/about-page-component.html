            <h4>For Children & Our Program :</h4>
             <p>Funny Days Kindergarten believes children are unique individuals who develop at their own pace and approach – through play, exploration and discovery of their own environment and the people around them. We also believe that children are active learners with a natural curiosity to learn about themselves and their surroundings.<br>We agree that children have freedom to play because it is through play that their learning and development is fostered.<br>We feel that children need and have the right to feel secure and loved, and to develop strong relationships with their caregivers to develop to their full potential.</p>
